logger
======

This is another logger class based on PSR logger standard. It was inspired my monolog (one of te best loggers in php)

The goal of this logger is to provide more than one logger. In some applications you need a very big complex logger
for handling this app. Another small projects only needs a simple file logger. This inspired me to create three logger types:

- VerySimpleLogger (it's a file stream logger in one file)
- AdvancedLogger ()
